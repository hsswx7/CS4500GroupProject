Now we run Maven Clean then Maven install by right clicking on project root folder and hovering
over the Run As... tab. If we have an error that says that Maven is out of date, then we want
to right click on the root of the project and hover over Maven. The we want to select update
project and check the box that says update dependencies and snapshots. Click finish. We should be
