Used to trace an image and store coordinates of the line in a file for use.
Detailed instructions provided on execution.

To invoke in Java Program, include code:

Runtime runTime = Runtime.getRuntime();
Process process = runTime.exec(".\\RiverTracer\\RiverTracer.exe"); // or whatever the path ends up as

FILE "river.bmp" MUST be in the root directory (ie CS4500GroupProject, whenever I tried otherwise the image would NOT show up).
